# a fictional one, so macOS/WSL users aren't shown a directory that cannot exist.
#   1. BDTOOLS_SHARED_PROJECTS_ROOT — exported by the launcher, which resolved it
#      from the machine's recorded site config. An explicitly empty value is
#      authoritative: it DISABLES the shared root.
#   2. the user's own `shared_projects_root` setting — see shared_projects_root()
# There is no step 3. A site supplies its own value (bdtools records it in
# <BDTOOLS_HOME>/site.conf); this file contains no path of its own, so the same
# release is correct on macOS, WSL, Linux and OOD without editing.
#
# This used to be one lab server's projects path, guarded by is_dir(). The guard
# kept the value out of config.json off that server, but the literal still
# decided what "shared" MEANT: any other site with its own shared root got no
# shared projects at all, silently, because the only path this file would accept
# was one it could never have.
